##### PATH CONFIGURATIONS ######
#
# Make a copy of this file and save it in the root of the repository
# with a name ending in ".config". Then modify as necessary.
#
# The repository is configured to ignore all .config files, with the
# exception of default.config (which should never be modified).
#
# To use a configuration file with make, specify it in the 'make' command via
# "make <target> CONFIG=<name>", where '<name>' is the first part of the
# file name (before the .config). For example, "make library CONFIG=foo"
# would build the library (release target) using "foo.config".
#
# To use a configuration file with CMake directly, specify it by passing the
# argument "-DCONFIG_FILENAME=<name>", where '<name>' is the first part of the
# file name (before the .config). For example, passing the argument
# "-DCONFIG_FILENAME=foo" would build using "foo.config".

##### THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES #####
#
# This sets the path to eventpp.
# The build system will look for `include/' at this location.
#
# The default for it is '${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../libdeps/libs', which
# assumes a copy of the lib-git repository in the same directory as this
# repository folder.
#
# 'make eventpp' or 'make all' would need to be run in libdeps first.

set(EVENTPP_DIR
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../libdeps/libs
)

##### PAWLIB MINIMAL #####
#
# This sets the path to PawLIB Minimal.
# The build system will look for 'include/' at this location.
# Because PawLIB depends on IOSqueak for the full library, we only depend
# on the header-only library core.
#
# The default is '${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../pawlib/pawlib', which
# assumes a copy of the PawLIB git repository in the same directory as this
# repository folder.
#
# 'make minimal' would need to be run in that repository to generate the
# minimal version of the library.

set(PAWLIB_DIR
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../pawlib/pawlib
)


##### LLVM LIBC++ #####
#
# This option asks the Clang compiler to use LLVM's libc++ library.
# The build system will look for this library in the system paths.
#
# If you are not compiling with Clang, this option will be ignored.
# NOTE: libc++ is already used by default on Mac.
#
# Set the option to either `true` or `false` below.

set(LLVM false)


##### LINKER (LD) #####
#
# This option asks the compiler to use the specified linker instead of the
# default for your system. This assumes that the requested linker is
# installed on your system.
#
# Valid options:
#   -> "bfd" for the BFD linker
#   -> "gold" for Gold linker
#   -> "lld" for LLVM linker (only works on Clang)
#
# Uncomment the desired line below, or leave all commented to use default.

# set(LLD "bfd")
# set(LLD "gold")
# set(LLD "lld")
