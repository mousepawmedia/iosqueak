IOSqueak
========================================

<img src=docs/source/iosqueak.svg width=300vw/>

**Beautifully simple C++ input/output.**

IOSqueak provides tools for creating beautifully formatted output, without
having to memorize arcane codes. It also allows you to categorize and
prioritize your messages, and route them wherever they're needed.

See the [official project page](https://mousepawmedia.com/iosqueak).

> IOSqueak was originally part of PawLIB as IOChannel (not to be confused with
the unrelated GLib IOChannel).
